# AIAIART course

NEWS: I'm working on a successor to this course called 'The Generative Landscape' which will be out in November. Development for that will be happening in [this repository](https://github.com/johnowhitaker/genai).

This repo contains the notebooks used for the AIAIART course. Part 1 (first four lessons) ran via Discord in September/October 2021. Part 2 started in April 2022 and wrapped up with Lesson 9. Join the Discord linked below for course-related chat and reminders of any upcoming additions.

The videos for each lesson are linked within the notebooks, but can also be viewed in this YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23FjyM69j910zCdDFVWcjSIKHbSB7NE8
